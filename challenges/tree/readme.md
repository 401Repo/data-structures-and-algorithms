# Trees

I need classes for nodes, tree, and methods for the three

### Curent Tests

  #### Testing the tree

-    ✓ Can create a tree (2 ms)
-    ✓ Can create a tree with a root node
-    ✓ Can add right and left child nodes to root
-    ✓ Can return a preorder collection from tree (1 ms)
-    ✓ Can return a colletion of node values in order from tree (1 ms)
-    ✓ Can return a collection post order from the tree nodes
-    ✓ Can find the max val in a binary tree
-    ✓ Can return a fizzbuzztree from an input tree (1 ms)

## guide:

Read all of these instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described.
Do all your work in a public repository (matching the example provided by your instructor) called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formatted, detailed top-level README.md

Create a branch in your repository called tree
On your branch, create…
C#: Create a new class library named Trees. which contains files called Tree.cs, BinarySearchTree.cs, and Node.cs

JavaScript: a folder named tree which contains a file called tree.js
Python:a folder named tree which contains a file called tree.py
Java: a package named tree which contains files called Tree.java, BinarySearchTree.java, and Node.java

Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.
