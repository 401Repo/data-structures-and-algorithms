# Validator

We go on to create a validator of three types of matches: circular, square and squigly brackers. Spaces, letters, and any string not containing a matching closer bracket is to return a falsie.

-    ✓ Opening and closing brackets exist in the string (1 ms)
-    ✓ Can successfully return false if NOT all brackets are balanced and matching
