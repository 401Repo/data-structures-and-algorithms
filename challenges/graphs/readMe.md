# BFT:

I had to: create a graph, create a vertex, and create edges clases. Then i had to go ahead and make the edges between the vertexs.I created a directed graph from vertex A to F.

### Example:

My Graph is: (A) -> (B) -> (C) -> (D) -> (E) -> (F)

The way the function makes the transversal for the test is that i have to go to my fuction from a starting node:

bfs(starting node: 'A');

what this function does is that if takes A as the start of the node. Then using a queue and following the direction of the edges iterated thru the graph and returns a collection of the vertexes transversed.

### Test:

  Testing graphs
   
   -  âœ“ Should create a graph and do a bts (2 ms)
