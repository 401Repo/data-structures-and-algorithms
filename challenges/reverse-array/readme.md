# Reverse an Array

This is a challenege without using any helper methods to reverse an Array. 

### Curent Tests

##### Testing my reverse array function

-    âœ“ It should take an array and reverse it (2 ms)

This works by the funtion taking a new array and inverting the old one in to the new one in one loop. making the time O(n) nut the space O(1).

This is an iterative way of doing the reverse

Input = array = [1,2,3,4,5]
output = newArray = [5,4,3,2,1]
